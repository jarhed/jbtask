The combination of floral excellence, formal bedding schemes and the heritage of its backdrop make the gardens a very special place to visit. The site is meticulously maintained and has features of interest to a wide range of visitors including ancient monument ruins, an aviary, a refreshment kiosk, bowling green, tennis courts, water garden, rose garden, sensory garden, a section of the River Lark, a play area, pergola and public toilets. \nAbbey Gardens is much loved by both the local community and the many tourists who visit it throughout the year. It is a stunning venue for the many and varied cultural events which take place in Bury St Edmunds including the annual Bury Festival. The Abbey Gardens received the Green Flag award in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014The Abbey Gardens is owned by St Edmundsbury Borough Council. However, because it covers the major part of the precinct of the medieval abbey of St Edmund, it is under the guardianship of English Heritage as a scheduled ancient monument.\nAppleby Rose Garden\nOriginally an orchard, this is now a beautiful and established rose garden with over 400 rose bushes. The rose garden is named after John Appleby, an American serviceman based at Rougham. A donation of royalties from his book 'Suffolk Summer' saw the rose garden come to life. A bench made from the wing of an American 'Flying Fortress Bomber' and a memorial stone pays tribute to the many US servicemen and women stationed in Suffolk.\nPilgrims herb garden\nThe garden features many traditional medicinal plants believed to cure most ills and also ward off evil spirits. It was inspired by a now famous manuscript written at the Abbey in the 13th century which is housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.",

Shortly after this the leagues were introduced into Rugby Union.\n \nThe development of the Youth structure has brought its rewards as in 2001 the 1st Team with many home grown players were promoted to London 3 North East.\n \nIn 2007, the 1st Team again won the league and were promoted to London Division 2 North. For the first time in its history in 2007 the Colts won a national title taking the National Plate trophy at Franklins Gardens - the Home of Northampton Saints.\n \nWith youth teams, female teams and a leading 1st team in the region, the club continues to go from strength to strength with history being made each year.",

But every cup of their Mocha Italia blend created since then has helped them in their quest. Now they're the nation's favourite coffee shop and yet another step closer to a world where bland, average coffee is consigned to history. Want to find out more? How could you resist?\n\nCreating great coffee is an art that takes time and skill to perfect. And with 40 years of experience, they like to think that they've done just that. In that time they've discovered the finest beans, equipment and techniques to make sure that every cup makes the grade.\n\nNow you just have to make a decision -which cup will you go for in-store today?",

    "Body": "With almost 200 acres of landscaped Suffolk countryside there is something for everyone at Nowton Park.  \n\nNature lovers can visit the unique arboretum which is home to trees from around the world such as eucalyptus from Australia, paperbark maple from China and Kentucky coffee trees from North America. \nA panda was carved in 1998 and placed in the China region along with some bamboo to add to the vision of this geographical area.  \nThe Nowton Park totem pole stands 35.4 feet (10.8m) tall near the centre of the North American region of the arboretum. It is carved from a western red cedar which is the species traditionally favoured by Native Americans for their totem poles.\n\nTo your left when looking towards the main house from the lime avenue, you will see the bird feeding station on the edge of the wood. In the winter a variety of woodland birds can be seen such as the blue, great and long tailed tit, nuthatch and the great spotted woodpecker\n\nThe lime avenue is one of the finest examples in the UK and was planted around 1880 to give the estate a sense of grandeur. In spring over 100,000 daffodils bloom beneath the trees. \n\nNowton Park also has a fantastic maze in the shape of a stylised oak tree (in commemoration of the Oakes family who were the former estate owners). The maze is open from May to October every year and is south of the park, 2km from the main car park. There are 2,500 hornbeam trees that make up over two miles of hedging, maintained at a height of around two metres. The centre of the maze is marked by a fastigiate oak (with upright branches).\nThere are two ponds in Nowton Park - the meadow pond which is rich in aquatic life and is a draw for grass snakes as a place to bask, hunt and swim, and the school pond which is home to moorhens, mallards and the occasional grey heron which feeds on the introduced mirror and crucian carp.\n\nThe introduction of the wildflower meadow in 1990 with wildflowers, like birdsfoot trefoil has boosted the numbers of butterflies recorded in the park.\nThe park is also home to a large play area, football pitches, a picnic area and visitor centre.",

Kitchen offers all visitors a warm welcome and a great new place to eat and meet.\n \nThe former Refectory has been transformed over the winter months into an inviting eating space with rustic furniture, quirky chapel chairs, pots of fresh herbs and heritage colours. Comfy sofas offer a more relaxed area for a cup of coffee, or the chance to catch up friends ? young friends are catered for too, with highchairs and toys. Wifi is now available. We are delighted to be offering Suffolk-based Paddy and Scott?s coffee as well as Fairtrade tea, James White Apple juice and a choice of Fairtrade wine or the iconic Greene King St Edmund?s ale.\n \nHome cooked, locally sourced fayre, the signature food of chef, Paul Hughes, still tops the menu, so if warming stews, sausage and mash and fish on Fridays are your favourites, you need look no further.  You?ll probably get tempted by Apple Crumble or warm Chocolate Brownie for pudding too. Order at the counter, and the staff will bring your freshly prepared meal to you.\n \nLocally sourced ingredients  - sauces from Stokes of Woodbridge, jams and chutneys from Elveden Estates and bread from Gastono-me ? are key to the choice of food on offer.\n \nCakes baked on the premises as well as the famous cheese scones will be back on the menu. Get there early for the scones as these are a favourite of the Cathedral staff! \n \nIf you?re on the move, Pilgrims? Kitchen is offering an enhanced takeaway service ? whether it?s a quick coffee, a Danish pastry or your sandwich choice wrapped up in a neat box.",

It was re-named The Athenaeum in 1854 and is a Grade I listed building comprising a number or spaces available for hire, including the ornate Georgian Ballroom, its chandeliered ceiling and grand d�cor being reminiscent of the days of Pride and Prejudice. Now owned by St Edmundsbury Borough Council and managed in association with the Council?s catering partners, Sodexo Prestige, it is well known as a ?local venue for local people?, playing host to wedding receptions, balls, conferences, dinners and much, much more.\nThe Athenaeum with its splendid frontage stands proudly in Angel Hill ? physically, very much in the centre of historic Bury St Edmunds and intellectually, right at the heart of much of Bury?s history. The building is adjacent to St Edmundsbury Cathedral, the impressive, 12th century Norman Tower and the magnificent Abbey Gate, which was of course the entrance to the Abbey grounds where once stood one of the most powerful and influential monasteries in England. It is also right next to the Angel Hotel where Dickens stayed in 1859 and 1861 when he was giving readings in the Athenaeum. The Bury St Edmunds branch holds a lovely letter from Dickens, thanking his friend Mr Thompson, who was at the time the proprietor of the subscription rooms (now the Athenaeum) and who had arranged for him to read from David Copperfield.\nA feature of the Athenaeum which is of particular interest is a fair-sized, domed observatory on the roof, containing a telescope. A lecture on Astronomy was held by Sir James Airy, 7th Astronomer Royal in October 1858, at which time, by happy coincidence, the impressive Donati?s comet happened to be looming large in the night sky. These two events combined, so inspired members of the Institute that they felt moved to build the observatory! Airy advised on the design of the dome and choice of telescope to furnish it, which was to be enjoyed by the thriving Astronomical Society that arose to utilise it. The observatory today has fallen into disrepair, but still exists as a fantastic time capsule of Victorian astronomy.",

    "Body": "The Norman Tower, which was the principal gateway into Bury St Edmunds' great abbey church, houses a fine peal of twelve bells (with a thirteenth semitone bell).\nThe original ten bells were cast by Thomas Osborn of Downham Market in 1785. The heaviest bell, the 'tenor', weighs just over 27 hundredweight and sounds a C# note. In 1973 the bells were re-hung by Taylors of Loughborough in a cast iron frame lower down the tower, with their original wooden frame preserved higher up. In 2010 an appeal was launched to augment the bells to a cathedral ring of 12, and two new trebles (lighter bells) were dedicated on Easter Sunday 2012, then hung and rung for the first time on Easter Monday. In 2013, a 13th bell was added. This helps learner ringers, as there is a requirement to learn on 8 bells before progressing to higher numbers (10 and 12) - a ring of 10 bells contains within it only 1 true octave, that comprising the 8 heaviest bells, but the provision of a 13th (semitone) bell makes a lighter octave available in the ring of 12.\nApproximately 175 full peals have been rung since records began in November 1879. The bells are rung on Sundays from 9.00 am for the 10 o'clock Eucharist, and quarter peals are regularly rung before Sunday evensong. The bells are also rung for weddings and other special occasions. \nThe tower is regularly open to the public for the National Heritage Open Day event in September.",

A memorial to this martyrdom stands in the forecourt of the church. The church has been located in Whiting Street since 1697, the building completed in 1708. Formally part of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, the church has, since 1972, been a part of the United Reformed Church. As a church, it continued to witness to its founding principles, but is also a place of welcome for all. \n\nWeekly we meet to worship at 10.45am on a Sunday. On a Wednesday we hold a brief service at 9.45am, ideal if you can't make it to church on a Sunday. \n\nThe activities of the church, however, are much wider with regular groups meeting throughout the week, including groups that play scrabble and carpet bowls. There is a parent and toddler group, Tots and Tinies, every Monday in term time and a coffee morning every Wednesday. These sessions, also allow us to work with one of our neighbours, the Info Bar where support is offered to adults with multiple and complex needs and to their carers. \n\nOur weekly activities are as follows:\n \nMondays: Tots and Tinies (term time) 9.30 - 11.30 am\nTuesdays: Scrabble 2.00pm (2nd & 4th Tuesdays)\nWednesdays: 9.45 am a short time of worship.\nWednesdays: 10.00 am Coffee Morning\nWednesdays: (3rd Wednesday) Lunch 12.30 - to be pre booked on 01284 762459\nFridays: Carpet Bowls 7 pm\n \nFurther information can be found on our website here.\n \nAreas of our premises are also available for hire.
