# Task for JB

Apologies for the late submission.

Everything should be self-contained.

```
$ git pull
$ npm install
$ composer install
$ php artisan serve
```

Front end with VueJS, backend with Laravel.

1. When lifted, the json is converted to models and put in the database
2. When the page is loaded, records are pulled from the database and are searchable
3. Sorry about the design. Much as I try, I will never be a designer.
4. Added static Google Maps things as they're handy

There are quite a few known issues in here, I'm afraid I ran out of time
