Apologies for the late submission.

Everything should be self-contained.

```
$ git pull
$ php artisan serve
```

1. When lifted, the json is converted to models and put in the database
2. When the page is loaded, records are pulled from the database and are searchable
3. Sorry about the design. Much as I try, I will never be a designer.
4. Added static Google Maps things as they're handy
